# Editor configuration, see https://editorconfig.org
# EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on
# the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format
# for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file
# format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.
